# Project-3

## Problem

User’s manuals are long, bulky, and difficult to navigate. At times, it can take a user much longer to find an answer to a question that it takes them to actually address the problem. 

## Solution
If there were an AI model that could be trained on a PDF-based user’s manual, any question that a user might have could be answered quickly, without the need for endless digging & searching
